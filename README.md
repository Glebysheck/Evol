This project is a simulation of the life of small bacteria. The rules of this simulation are simple: food of plant origin randomly appears on the field, bacteria with a different set of genes randomly appear and their main task is to multiply. To reproduce, they need to gain a certain amount of nutrients, when a cell divides, a new cell can get new mutations that will help it survive and reproduce in the future
